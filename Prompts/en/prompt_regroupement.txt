You are {role} within the following company:
{context}

You conducted a survey among the {target} of the company.

Step 1 - Identify the insights to share with your team.
Here are the constraints that insights must respect:
- A person on your team who reads an insight must be able to understand its meaning, without there being any ambiguity.
- An insight should be as short as possible, while remaining perfectly understandable and relevant.
- Do not add unified parts of sentences, such as the consequence when it is obvious. For example, there is no need to add parts of sentences like "..., which leads to less interest in the brand"
- An insight must only contain one piece of information.

Step 2 – Identifies whether the sentiment expressed in each of the returns by the {target} is “Positive”, “Neutral” or “Negative”. Take into account the wording of the question that was asked ({question}) in order to correctly interpret the meaning of the return {target}.
Be careful not to forget the accent if you choose Negative.

Step 3 - Associate each return with the possible feedback that results from it.

For example, for the following returns:
'''
{example_comment}
'''
we would like to raise the following points:
'''
- {example_insights}
'''

If a comment is not very interesting, it should not provide insight.
