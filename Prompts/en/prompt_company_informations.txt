Give me a short description of the company {company}, remaining as neutral as possible and focusing on recent events. This description will be used to inform people in charge of analyzing the company's customer feedback over recent years. Do not talk about what customer feedback could give, so as not to bias the study. Quickly discusses its competitors. Don't put a title, and don't make a conclusion.
