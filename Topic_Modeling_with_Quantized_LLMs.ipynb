We consider the setting in which one has perfect observation of the\\n$X$-part of the sample, while the $Y$-part has to be communicated at some\\nfinite bit rate. The encoding of the $Y$-values is allowed to depend on the\\n$X$-values. Under suitable regularity conditions on the admissible predictors,\\nthe underlying family of probability distributions and the loss function, we\\ngive an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictor\\nperformance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions.

To consider this problem, we address a number\\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques.

In a setting generalizing the multi-armed\\nbandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the\\nweights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an\\nalgorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of\\nthe best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by\\na quantity that is proportional to 1/\\\\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on\\nthe number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear\\ncomplexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension\\nto the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision\\nmaker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen\\npath at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the\\ndecision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the\\nproblem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit\\nsetting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns\\nonly the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual\\nedges on the path.

Second, we introduce\\nimmediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm\\nfor blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO\\nproblem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two\\ncontributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution\\nwe validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and\\nbagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures\\nignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated\\nvalues of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations\\nare considered.

The\\nefficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined\\nwith further processing can operate at frame rate.\\n  Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic\\nfor feature detection, and using machine learning we derive a feature detector\\nfrom this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5% of the\\navailable processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even\\noperate at frame rate (Harris detector 115%, SIFT 195%).

              " '  In this paper, we consider the coherent theory of (epistemic) uncertainty of\\nWalley, in which beliefs are represented through sets of probability\\ndistributions, and we focus on the problem of modeling prior ignorance about a\\ncategorical random variable. In this setting, it is a known result that a state\\nof prior ignorance is not compatible with learning. To overcome this problem,\\nanother state of beliefs, called \\\\emph{near-ignorance}, has been proposed.\\nNear-ignorance resembles ignorance very closely, by satisfying some principles\\nthat can arguably be regarded as necessary in a state of ignorance, and allows\\nlearning to take place. What this paper does, is to provide new and substantial\\nevidence that also near-ignorance cannot be really regarded as a way out of the\\nproblem of starting statistical inference in conditions of very weak beliefs.\\nThe key to this result is focusing on a setting characterized by a variable of\\ninterest that is \\\\emph{latent}. We argue that such a setting is by far the most\\ncommon case in practice, and we provide, for the case of categorical latent\\nvariables (and general \\\\emph{manifest} variables) a condition that, if\\nsatisfied, prevents learning to take place under prior near-ignorance. This\\ncondition is shown to be easily satisfied even in the most common statistical\\nproblems. We regard these results as a strong form of evidence against the\\npossibility to adopt a condition of prior near-ignorance in real statistical\\nproblems.\\n',\n",

We describe an\\napplication of temporal data mining for analyzing fault logs in an engine\\nassembly plant. Frequent episode discovery framework is a model-free method\\nthat can be used to deduce (temporal) correlations among events from the logs\\nin an efficient manner. In addition to being theoretically elegant and\\ncomputationally efficient, frequent episodes are also easy to interpret in the\\nform actionable recommendations. Incorporation of domain-specific information\\nis critical to successful application of the method for analyzing fault logs in\\nthe manufacturing domain. We show how domain-specific knowledge can be\\nincorporated using heuristic rules that act as pre-filters and post-filters to\\nfrequent episode discovery. The system described here is currently being used\\nin one of the engine assembly plants of General Motors and is planned for\\nadaptation in other plants. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents\\nthe first real, large-scale application of temporal data mining in the\\nmanufacturing domain. We believe that the ideas presented in this paper can\\nhelp practitioners engineer tools for analysis in other similar or related\\napplication domains as well.\\n',\n",
              " '  The problem of multi-agent learning and adaptation has attracted a great deal\\nof attention in recent years. It has been suggested that the dynamics of multi\\nagent learning can be studied using replicator equations from population\\nbiology. Most existing studies so far have been limited to discrete strategy\\nspaces with a small number of available actions. In many cases, however, the\\nchoices available to agents are better characterized by continuous spectra.\\nThis paper suggests a generalization of the replicator framework that allows to\\nstudy the adaptive dynamics of Q-learning agents with continuous strategy\\nspaces. Instead of probability vectors, agents strategies are now characterized\\nby probability measures over continuous variables. As a result, the ordinary\\ndifferential equations for the discrete case are replaced by a system of\\ncoupled integral--differential replicator equations that describe the mutual\\nevolution of individual agent strategies. We derive a set of functional\\nequations describing the steady state of the replicator dynamics, examine their\\nsolutions for several two-player games, and confirm our analytical results\\nusing simulations.\\n',\n",

              " '  Motivated by the philosophy and phenomenal success of compressed sensing, the\\nproblem of reconstructing a matrix from a sampling of its entries has attracted\\nmuch attention recently. Such a problem can be viewed as an\\ninformation-theoretic variant of the well-studied matrix completion problem,\\nand the main objective is to design an efficient algorithm that can reconstruct\\na matrix by inspecting only a small number of its entries. Although this is an\\nimpossible task in general, Cand\\\\`es and co-authors have recently shown that\\nunder a so-called incoherence assumption, a rank $r$ $n\\\\times n$ matrix can be\\nreconstructed using semidefinite programming (SDP) after one inspects\\n$O(nr\\\\log^6n)$ of its entries. In this paper we propose an alternative approach\\nthat is much more efficient and can reconstruct a larger class of matrices by\\ninspecting a significantly smaller number of the entries. Specifically, we\\nfirst introduce a class of so-called stable matrices and show that it includes\\nall those that satisfy the incoherence assumption. Then, we propose a\\nrandomized basis pursuit (RBP) algorithm and show that it can reconstruct a\\nstable rank $r$ $n\\\\times n$ matrix after inspecting $O(nr\\\\log n)$ of its\\nentries. Our sampling bound is only a logarithmic factor away from the\\ninformation-theoretic limit and is essentially optimal. Moreover, the runtime\\nof the RBP algorithm is bounded by $O(nr^2\\\\log n+n^2r)$, which compares very\\nfavorably with the $\\\\Omega(n^4r^2\\\\log^{12}n)$ runtime of the SDP-based\\nalgorithm. Perhaps more importantly, our algorithm will provide an exact\\nreconstruction of the input matrix in polynomial time. By contrast, the\\nSDP-based algorithm can only provide an approximate one in polynomial time.\\n',\n",
              " '  Growing neuropsychological and neurophysiological evidence suggests that the\\nvisual cortex uses parts-based representations to encode, store and retrieve\\nrelevant objects. In such a scheme, objects are represented as a set of\\nspatially distributed local features, or parts, arranged in stereotypical\\nfashion. To encode the local appearance and to represent the relations between\\nthe constituent parts, there has to be an appropriate memory structure formed\\nby previous experience with visual objects. Here, we propose a model how a\\nhierarchical memory structure supporting efficient storage and rapid recall of\\nparts-based representations can be established by an experience-driven process\\nof self-organization.

A consequence of this result is that the GLRT is optimal in\\ndifferentiating a particular distribution from others in an exponential family.\\nIt is also shown that the mismatched test has a significant advantage over the\\nHoeffding test in terms of finite sample size performance. This advantage is\\ndue to the difference in the asymptotic variances of the two test statistics\\nunder the null hypothesis. In particular, the variance of the K-L divergence\\ngrows linearly with the alphabet size, making the test impractical for\\napplications involving large alphabet distributions.

Each arm,\\nwhen played, offers i.i.d. reward according to a distribution with an unknown\\nparameter. At each time, each player chooses one arm to play without exchanging\\nobservations or any information with other players. Players choosing the same\\narm collide, and, depending on the collision model, either no one receives\\nreward or the colliding players share the reward in an arbitrary way. We show\\nthat the minimum system regret of the decentralized MAB grows with time at the\\nsame logarithmic order as in the centralized counterpart where players act\\ncollectively as a single entity by exchanging observations and making decisions\\njointly. A decentralized policy is constructed to achieve this optimal order\\nwhile ensuring fairness among players and without assuming any pre-agreement or\\ninformation exchange among players. Based on a Time Division Fair Sharing\\n(TDFS) of the M best arms, the proposed policy is constructed and its order\\noptimality is proven under a general reward model.

For the case of translation-invariant\\nkernels, the proposed mechanism minimizes regularized empirical risk in a\\nrandom Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space whose kernel uniformly approximates the\\ndesired kernel with high probability. This technique, borrowed from large-scale\\nlearning, allows the mechanism to respond with a finite encoding of the\\nclassifier, even when the function class is of infinite VC dimension.\\nDifferential privacy is established using a proof technique from algorithmic\\nstability. Utility--the mechanism's response function is pointwise\\nepsilon-close to non-private SVM with probability 1-delta--is proven by\\nappealing to the smoothness of regularized empirical risk minimization with\\nrespect to small perturbations to the feature mapping. We conclude with a lower\\nbound on the optimal differential privacy of the SVM.

In this paper, we propose two new types of\\nprobabilistic graphical models, large margin Boltzmann machines (LMBMs) and\\nlarge margin sigmoid belief networks (LMSBNs), for structured prediction.\\nLMSBNs in particular allow a very fast inference algorithm for arbitrary graph\\nstructures that runs in polynomial time with a high probability. This\\nprobability is data-distribution dependent and is maximized in learning. The\\nnew approach overcomes the representation-efficiency trade-off in previous\\nmodels and allows fast structured prediction with complicated graph structures.\\nWe present results from applying a fully connected model to multi-label scene\\nclassification and demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield significant\\nperformance gains over current state-of-the-art methods.\\n',\n",

Furthermore, using the game's potential\\nproperty, we derive a modified version of the replicator dynamics of\\nevolutionary game theory which applies to this continuous game, and we show\\nthat if the network's users employ a distributed learning scheme based on these\\ndynamics, then they converge to equilibrium exponentially quickly. On the other\\nhand, a major challenge occurs if the channels do not remain static but\\nfluctuate stochastically over time, following a stationary ergodic process.

On the other hand, he has no knowledge\\nof the underlying probability function generating the coalitions' values. Our\\ngoal is to find allocation rules that use a measure of the extra reward that a\\ncoalition has received up to the current time by re-distributing the budget\\namong the players.

First, we design an\\nallocation rule based on full observation of the extra reward so that the\\naverage allocation approaches a specific point in the core of the average game,\\nwhile the coalitions' excesses converge to an a priori given direction. Second,\\nwe design a new allocation rule based on partial observation on the extra\\nreward so that the average allocation converges to the core of the average\\ngame, while the coalitions' excesses converge to an a priori given cone.
